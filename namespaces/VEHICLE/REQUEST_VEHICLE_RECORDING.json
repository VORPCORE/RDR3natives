For example, REQUEST_VEHICLE_RECORDING(1, \"FBIs1UBER\") corresponds to fbis1uber001.yvr.\nFor all vehicle recording/playback natives, \"script\" is a common prefix that usually corresponds to the script/mission the recording is used in, \"recording\" is its int suffix, and \"id\" corresponds to a unique identifier within the recording streaming module.\n(GTA) Note that only 24 recordings (hardcoded in multiple places) can ever active at a given time before clobbering begins.",
