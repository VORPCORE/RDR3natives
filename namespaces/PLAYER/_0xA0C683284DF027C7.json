The flag value determines whether the player can wear all hats or only the ones they own.\nIf the flag is set to 15 and `allow` is true, the player can wear all available hats. However, if you want to restrict the player to wearing only their owned hats (flag 1), you **must first** disable flag 15 by setting it to false, and then set flag 1 to true.",
