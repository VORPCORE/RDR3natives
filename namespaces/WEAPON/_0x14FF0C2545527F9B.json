Use 0xE9BD19F8121ADE3E before using this native\nNotes:\n- Must call _SEND_WEAPON_TO_INVENTORY (0xE9BD19F8121ADE3E) beforehand to move the weapon into the horse inventory. That native makes it accessible from the weapon wheel but not visible; this native makes it visible on the horse.\n- Works at a distance; proximity to the horse is not required.",
