        "comment": "Sets the explosion or impact effect radius of a projectile entity (e.g., thrown dynamite or similar explosives).\nNotes:\n- Must be called before the projectile explodes; changing the radius afterward has no effect.\n- Commonly used after retrieving the projectile entity with MISC::GET_PROJECTILE_OF_PROJECTILE_TYPE_WITHIN_DISTANCE.\n- This does not trigger an explosion; it only defines how large the explosion’s area of effect will be.\n- Compared to MISC::ADD_EXPLOSION, which spawns a new explosion at a location, this modifies an existing projectile’s explosion properties.",
